# Overview

Very easy to use, ultra-low power Wi-Fi module, which can run directly on batteries. Designed for developers at all skill levels from advanced to those who just start building IOT devices.

Cricket is a perfect choice if you want to build IOT end nodes such as sensors, alarms, buttons, switches,  etc. to report data and events instantenously from remote locations. What is really cool is the ultra-low power feature, which will make your devices to run on single batteries for a very long time (for years in many use cases).

With Cricket you can connect various peripherals to Wi-Fi out of the box; send data and events either within local network or to the internet. Simply attach a battery and peripheral(s) to Cricket and your device is ready to go.

Cricket comes with a native support of MQTT and HTTP POST / GET protocols that allow you to integrate your devices to a huge ecosystem of software and internet services such as e.g. IFTTT, Home Assistant, Node-RED, automate.io, Google Docs, Emails, Mobile Apps ... 

Cricket works with all standard Wi-Fi routers and it doesn't require IOT hubs. No coding nor programming is required as it comes with a pre-installed software. You configure Cricket entirely over the air either from a smartphone or a laptop (without fiddling and troubleshooting toolchains). It can be done either locally (toe_device WiFi hotspot) or remotely from the HTTP micro-service (http://cota.thingsonedge.com)
